Project Title:

Compression studies project

Description:

This code will exavuate the effect of different compression techneques on several different
indicies that pertain to environmental remote sensing.

How to run:

Ensure the indicies .py folders are in the same directory as the main.py
by running the main it will generate the output graph
Output:

The output graphs will represent the indicies as well as the means, standard deviations and the
percent differences for each image compression with the original.
